## My process

I started with the outermost elements and worked my way in as I began to refine the smaller details, tweaking the values as I saw fit.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I found a method to get as close as possible to the referrence image by using Alt-Tab to compare the image over my output and see exactly where I need to make adjustments.

### Continued development

I had some trouble figuring out the exact spacing between the text and the border of the card. I will continue refine my CSS skills through regular practice and research.

### Useful resources

- [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com) - This website has been very usefull for me.
